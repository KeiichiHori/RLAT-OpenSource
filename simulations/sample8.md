## Simulation Sample 8

### Overview
Building on Simulation Sample 7, modify and add settings for analysis. Add necessary parameters and record population, GDP, and power structure after 100 years. Provide detailed results for types 1-1 and 2-3, with trends for other types. Since Grok 3 cannot generate images, describe graph content in detail using text, clearly outlining the intended visualization.

### Simulation Procedure
1. Calculate growth from initial conditions to Year 5, applying the fixed disaster in Year 5.
2. From Year 6, randomly trigger:
   - Technological innovation (1–1.5% annually)
   - Natural disasters (2% annually)
   - Civil unrest
   - War
   - Sanctions
3. Adjust power structure fluidly and modify population dynamics for dispersed types via cultural influence.
4. Record population, GDP, and power structure after 100 years.

- **Trends (Other Types)**:
  - 1-2, 1-4: Stagnant trade and higher sanction probability suppress GDP growth.
  - 2-1: Low civil unrest risk but increased sanctions due to poor diplomacy, moderate growth.
  - 2-2, 2-4: High civil unrest and war risks lead to low population and GDP growth.
- **Visualization Description**:
  - Use distinct colors for each type (e.g., 1-1 = red, 2-3 = green).
  - X-axis: Time (Year 5, Year 100), Y-axis: Metric values.
  - Line charts to visualize trends for each metric.
  - Highlight 1-1’s high GDP growth and 2-3’s stable population dynamics.
  - Emphasize post-disaster resilience and power fluidity (e.g., 1-1’s shift to weaker concentration).

### Analysis
Analyze the following aspects:
- Relationship between technological innovation timing and GDP growth.
- Randomness of natural disasters and each type’s resilience.
- Population dynamics influenced by dispersed cultural effects (e.g., increased birth rates).
- Maximum lifespan (e.g., proportion surviving past 100 years).
- Maximum births per individual (e.g., lifetime births per woman).
- Impact of power fluidity on population and GDP.
- Growth differences due to diplomatic and trade interactions.
