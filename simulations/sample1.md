## RLAT: Simulation Data

### Overview
After copying and pasting the core and additional parameters into Open AI, inputting Simulation Sample 1 should generate analysis results.  
Feel free to modify parts or all of the settings or scenarios to experiment. While precise instructions regarding structure and parameter mappings are needed to some extent, the system is designed to be intuitively operable.  
Parameters can be freely added, and definitions can be modified. By loading RLAT parameters and inputting words into Open AI, new parameters can be generated. Definitions can also be revised.  
We welcome your feedback or opinions.

### Simulation Sample 1

The power structure of a community can be categorized into four types:
1. Power is concentrated in a few and strong (e.g., dictator).
2. Power is concentrated in a few and weak (e.g., club).
3. Power is relatively dispersed and strong (e.g., surveillance society).
4. Power is relatively dispersed and weak (e.g., hippie community).

Analyze the characteristics of these types from the RLAT perspective, considering the following aspects. Divide the analysis into internal (within the community) and external (the communityâ€™s relationship with external entities) perspectives:
- Specificity and strength of norms
- Fluidity or fixation of power
- Response to disasters
- Response to wars
- Population trends
- Area trends
- Economic strength trends
- Cultural strength trends
- Military strength trends
- Technological strength trends
- Wealth disparity
- Other comparable characteristics (e.g., education, healthcare, diplomacy)

**Initial Conditions**:
- Area, population, economic strength, cultural strength, military strength, and technological strength are all equal across types.
- The economic strength of individual citizens is uniform.

**Additional Analysis**:
- Identify and explain any outcomes correlated with the concentration (concentrated/dispersed) and strength (strong/weak) of power.
