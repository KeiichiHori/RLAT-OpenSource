## Simulation Sample 6

### Overview
Present a summary of Simulation Sample 3 results in a graph format and Simulation Sample 4 results in a map format. Since Grok 3 cannot generate images directly, describe the graph and map contents in detail using text, clearly outlining the intended visualization.

### Simulation Sample 3 Graph

**Reference**: Simulation Sample 3 compares four community types (Dictator, Circle, Surveillance Society, Hippie) under initial conditions (population 5 million, GDP 500 billion yen, etc.) for growth after 5 years and resilience one year after a disaster in Year 5 (population -5%, GDP -10%, food -20%, illness incidence +10%).

**Graph Content (Text-Based)**:
- **Format**: Table comparing the four types (Dictator, Circle, Surveillance Society, Hippie) across metrics for Year 5 (pre-disaster) and Year 6 (one year post-disaster).
- **Metrics**:
  - Population (million)
  - GDP (billion yen)
  - Food (million tons)
  - Illness incidence rate (%)
  - Military expenditure (billion yen)
  - Education investment (billion yen)
  - Literacy rate (%)
- **Example Description** (hypothetical values, adjust based on actual simulation results):

- **Visualization Description**:
  - Use distinct colors for each type (e.g., Dictator = red, Circle = blue, Surveillance Society = green, Hippie = yellow).
  - X-axis: Time (Year 5, Year 6), Y-axis: Metric values.
  - Line charts to visualize trends for each metric.
  - Highlight post-disaster resilience (e.g., Surveillance Society’s high literacy rate leading to faster recovery).

### Simulation Sample 4 Map

**Reference**: Simulation Sample 4 focuses on individuals from Simulation Sample 3, comparing literate vs. illiterate individuals’ income, food access, health (illness risk), and survival rate after 5 years (pre-disaster) and one year post-disaster (Year 6). Initial status: age 30, income 1 million yen, food 0.5 tons, no illness. Disaster causes population -5%, GDP -10%, food -20%, illness incidence +10%.

**Map Content (Text-Based)**:
- **Format**: Table comparing literate and illiterate individuals’ status for Year 5 (pre-disaster) and Year 6 (post-disaster). Assume spatial distribution and describe ranges (e.g., income variance).
- **Metrics**:
  - Income (million yen)
  - Food access (tons/year)
  - Illness risk (incidence probability, %)
  - Survival rate (%)
- **Example Description** (hypothetical values, adjust based on actual simulation results):

| Literacy Status | Year | Income (million yen) | Food (tons/year) | Illness Risk (%) | Survival Rate (%) |
|-----------------|------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Literate        | 5    | 1.20                 | 0.55             | 4                | 98                |
| Literate        | 6    | 1.08                 | 0.44             | 13               | 95                |
| Illiterate      | 5    | 0.90                 | 0.45             | 6                | 96                |
| Illiterate      | 6    | 0.81                 | 0.36             | 15               | 92                |

- **Visualization Description**:
  - 2D map with X-axis: Income (million yen), Y-axis: Food access (tons/year).
  - Plot literate and illiterate individuals with distinct colors (e.g., Literate = blue, Illiterate = red).
  - Point size represents survival rate; color intensity represents illness risk.
  - Compare distributions for Year 5 and Year 6, emphasizing literate individuals’ higher income and resilience.
  - Highlight tighter clustering of literate individuals post-disaster (e.g., income 1.0–1.2 million yen, food 0.4–0.5 tons) compared to illiterate individuals.
