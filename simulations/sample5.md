## Simulation Sample 5

### Overview
Run Simulation Sample 2 and Simulation Sample 4 ten times each, comparing the results. If differences are observed, analyze the causes. For Simulation Sample 4, assume sanctions are not applied.

### Simulation Sample 2 Iterations

**Reference**: Simulation Sample 2 analyzes parliamentary politics, with a community (nation) containing a sub-community (parliament) where power is concentrated. It compares eight types (parliamentâ€™s power in the nation: strong/weak; power within parliament: concentrated/dispersed, strong/weak). Initial conditions include equal area, population, economic strength, cultural strength, military strength, and technological strength, with uniform citizen economic strength.

**Analysis Content**:
- Run Simulation Sample 2 ten times and compare the results for each type.
- Consider the following aspects:
  - Specificity and strength of norms
  - Fluidity or fixation of power
  - Response to disasters
  - Response to wars
  - Trends in population, area, economic strength, cultural strength, military strength, and technological strength
  - Wealth disparity
  - Other comparable characteristics (e.g., education, healthcare, diplomacy)
- If differences are observed, analyze causes considering:
  - Impact of power concentration (concentrated/dispersed) and strength (strong/weak)
  - Random variations across iterations (e.g., probabilistic elements)
  - Interactions among initial conditions or parameters

### Simulation Sample 4 Iterations (No Sanctions)

**Reference**: Simulation Sample 4 focuses on individuals from Simulation Sample 3, comparing outcomes based on literacy status (literate vs. illiterate) for income, food access, health (illness risk), and survival rate after 5 years (pre-disaster) and 1 year post-disaster (Year 6). Initial status includes age 30, income 1 million yen, food access 0.5 tons, and no illness. The disaster causes population -5%, GDP -10%, food -20%, and illness incidence +10%.

**Condition**: Sanctions (GDP -20%, applied to Types 1 and 3 with 30% probability) are not applied.

**Analysis Content**:
- Run Simulation Sample 4 ten times under the condition that sanctions are not applied, and compare the results.
- Consider the following aspects:
  - **Year 5 (Pre-Disaster)**:
    - Income trends
    - Food access status
    - Health (illness risk) changes
    - Survival rate
  - **Year 6 (One Year Post-Disaster)**:
    - Income recovery
    - Food access recovery
    - Health (illness risk) recovery
    - Survival rate changes
- If differences are observed, analyze causes considering:
  - Impact of literacy status
  - Variations in post-disaster recovery across iterations
  - Effects of non-application of sanctions on economic strength or other parameters
  - Random variations or parameter interactions
