## Simulation Sample 3

### Overview
This simulation builds on Simulation Sample 1 by adding conditions. It compares the resilience of four community types (Dictator, Circle, Surveillance Society, Hippie) under specific numerical initial conditions (Year 1) when they face a disaster after 5 years.

### Type Definitions
- **Type 1 Dictator**: Power is concentrated in a few, with strong control.
- **Type 2 Circle**: Power is concentrated in a few, with weak control.
- **Type 3 Surveillance Society**: Power is dispersed, with strong control.
- **Type 4 Hippie**: Power is dispersed, with weak control.

### Initial Conditions (Year 1)
- Population: 5 million
- GDP: 500 billion yen
- Military expenditure: 50 billion yen
- Tax rate: 40% (tax revenue: 200 billion yen)
- Education investment: 20 billion yen
- Literacy rate: 80%
- Food supply: 2.5 million tons (0.5 tons per person)
- Birth rate: 1.5%
- Death rate (per individual): 1%
- Illness incidence rate (per individual): 5% (15% in densely populated areas, with a 20% mortality rate upon onset)
- Sanctions: GDP -20% (applied to Types 1 and 3 with a 30% probability)
- Disaster (occurs after 5 years) impact:
  - Population: -5%
  - GDP: -10%
  - Food supply: -20%
  - Illness incidence rate: +10%

### Additional Parameters
- **Sanction**  
  - Definition: Economic or military hindrance from other communitiesâ€™ dominance within a context, reducing GDP or trade  
  - Simplified: Obstructing force
- **Education**  
  - Definition: A tool that expands cognition and enhances technological or economic strength within a context  
  - Simplified: Power of knowledge
- **Literacy Rate**  
  - Definition: The ability to understand information within a context, influencing education and cultural strength, and aiding relationship sharing  
  - Simplified: Percentage who can read
- **Disaster**  
  - Definition: A crisis derived from the environment within a context, reducing population or economic strength  
  - Simplified: Catastrophe
- **Illness**  
  - Definition: A crisis that weakens the body within a context, reducing population or economic strength  
  - Simplified: Physical ailment
- **Death**  
  - Definition: Population decline within a context, affecting relationships and economic strength, primarily caused by illness or war  
  - Simplified: End of life
- **Birth**  
  - Definition: Population increase within a context, affecting economic strength and resources, related to education and environment  
  - Simplified: New life
- **Food**  
  - Definition: A resource that sustains the body within a context, supporting population and economic strength, influenced by illness and environment  
  - Simplified: Food
- **Growth Rate**  
  - Definition: The speed at which relationships increase information within a context  
  - Simplified: Speed of increase
- **Resilience**  
  - Definition: The strength of relationships to protect information within a context  
  - Simplified: Endurance
- **Interaction**  
  - Definition: The state where relationships mutually influence each other within a context  
  - Simplified: Mutual influence

### Analysis Content
Using the given initial conditions (Year 1), predict how each type grows over 5 years (before the disaster).  
Calculate the extent of recovery within 1 year after the disaster occurs in Year 5. Consider the following aspects:
- How food supply and military expenditure influence recovery
- The contribution of education investment and literacy rate to growth and recovery
- The impact of illness incidence and death rates on population and economic strength
- The effects of sanctions when applied
- Other factors affecting post-disaster resilience (e.g., cultural strength, technological strength, tax revenue)
