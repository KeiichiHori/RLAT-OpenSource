## Simulation Sample 2

### Overview
This simulation analyzes the structure of parliamentary politics. Specifically, it considers a community (nation) containing a sub-community (parliament) where power is concentrated in the parliament.  
This structure aligns with Types 1 and 2 (concentrated power) defined in Simulation Sample 1.  
The analysis further divides this structure into the following eight types:
- Type 1-1: The parliament’s power within the nation is strong, and power within the parliament is concentrated and strong.
- Type 1-2: The parliament’s power within the nation is strong, and power within the parliament is concentrated and weak.
- Type 1-3: The parliament’s power within the nation is strong, and power within the parliament is dispersed and strong.
- Type 1-4: The parliament’s power within the nation is strong, and power within the parliament is dispersed and weak.
- Type 2-1: The parliament’s power within the nation is weak, and power within the parliament is concentrated and strong.
- Type 2-2: The parliament’s power within the nation is weak, and power within the parliament is concentrated and weak.
- Type 2-3: The parliament’s power within the nation is weak, and power within the parliament is dispersed and strong.
- Type 2-4: The parliament’s power within the nation is weak, and power within the parliament is dispersed and weak.

### Analysis Content
Analyze the characteristics of these types from the RLAT perspective, using the same aspects as in Simulation Sample 1. Divide the analysis into internal (within the community) and external (the community’s relationship with external entities) perspectives:
- Specificity and strength of norms
- Fluidity or fixation of power
- Response to disasters
- Response to wars
- Population trends
- Area trends
- Economic strength trends
- Cultural strength trends
- Military strength trends
- Technological strength trends
- Wealth disparity
- Other comparable characteristics (e.g., education, healthcare, diplomacy)

**Initial Conditions**:
- Area, population, economic strength, cultural strength, military strength, and technological strength are all equal across types.
- The economic strength of individual citizens is uniform.

**Additional Analysis**:
- Identify and explain any outcomes correlated with the concentration (concentrated/dispersed) and strength (strong/weak) of power.
