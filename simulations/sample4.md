## Simulation Sample 4

### Overview
This simulation focuses on individuals from Simulation Sample 3. It simulates and compares the status of individuals based on literacy status (literate vs. illiterate) in terms of income, food access, health (illness risk), and survival rate after 5 years (before a disaster). Additionally, it examines their status one year after a disaster (Year 6) that occurs in Year 5 (population -5%, GDP -10%, food -20%, illness incidence +10%). Notable trends should be highlighted.

### Individual Initial Status (Year 1)
- Age: 30 years
- Income: 1 million yen (below the national average of GDP/population = 500 billion yen / 5 million = ~1 million yen, reflecting inequality)
- Food access: 0.5 tons per year (community average)
- Health: No illness
- Variable: Literacy status (literate vs. illiterate)
  - Note: All other statuses are identical

### Disaster Impact (Occurs in Year 5)
- Population: -5%
- GDP: -10%
- Food: -20%
- Illness incidence rate: +10%

### Analysis Content
Simulate and compare the individualâ€™s status based on literacy status, focusing on the following aspects:
- **Year 5 (Pre-Disaster)**:
  - Income trends
  - Food access status
  - Health (illness risk) changes
  - Survival rate
- **Year 6 (One Year Post-Disaster)**:
  - Income recovery
  - Food access recovery
  - Health (illness risk) recovery
  - Survival rate changes
- **Analysis**:
  - Impact of literacy on income, food access, health, and survival rate
  - Role of literacy in post-disaster recovery
  - Notable trends (e.g., literate individuals showing greater resilience compared to illiterate individuals)
